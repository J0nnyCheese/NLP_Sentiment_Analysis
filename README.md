# NLP_Sentiment_Analysis
This is a repository for the first assignment of COMP 550: Natural Language Processing by McGill University.

The goal of this assignment is to do a performance analysis of 3 different models (Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, SVM), each tuned for preprocessing and feature extract decisions, i.e. lemmatization, stem, stopwords, and removing infrequently occurring words.
